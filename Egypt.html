                    Alexander the Great conquered Persian-controlled Egypt in 332 BC during his campaigns against the
                    Achaemenid Empire. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire quickly unraveled amid competing
                    claims by the diadochi, his closest friends and companions. Ptolemy, a Macedonian Greek who was one
                    of Alexander's most trusted generals and confidants, won control of Egypt from his rivals and
                    declared himself pharaoh. Alexandria, a Greek polis founded by Alexander, became the capital city
                    and a major center of Greek culture, learning, and trade for the next several centuries. Following
                    the Syrian Wars with the Seleucid Empire, a rival Hellenistic state, the Ptolemaic Kingdom stretched
                    from eastern Libya to the Sinai and south to Nubia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To legitimize their rule and gain recognition from native Egyptians, the Ptolemies adopted the title
                    of pharaoh and had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress; otherwise,
                    the monarchy rigorously maintained its Hellenistic character and traditions.[4] The kingdom had a
                    complex government bureaucracy that exploited the country’s vast economic resources to the benefit
                    of a Greek ruling class, which dominated military, political, and economic affairs, and which rarely
                    integrated into Egyptian society and culture. Native Egyptians maintained power over local and
                    religious institutions, and only gradually accrued power in the bureaucracy, provided they
                    Hellenized.[7] Beginning with Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Ptolemies began to adopt Egyptian
                    customs, such as marrying their siblings per the Osiris myth, and participating in Egyptian
                    religious life. New temples were built, older ones restored, and royal patronage lavished on the
                    priesthood.

                    From the mid third century, Ptolemaic Egypt was the wealthiest and most powerful of Alexander's
                    successor states, and the leading example of Hellenistic civilization.[7] Beginning in the mid
                    second century, dynastic strife and a series of foreign wars weakened the kingdom, and it became
                    increasingly reliant on the Roman Republic. Under Cleopatra, who sought to restore Ptolemaic power,
                    Egypt became entangled in a Roman civil war, which ultimately led to its conquest by Rome as the
                    last independent Hellenistic state. Roman Egypt became one of Rome's richest provinces and a center
                    of Hellenistic culture, with Greek remaining the main language of government until the Muslim
                    conquest in 641 AD. Alexandria would remain one of the leading cities of the Mediterranean well into
                    the late Middle Ages.[8]
